# Facial Recognition App

The purpose of the project is to create a full-stack React application using facial recognition.

The user will be able to submit a photo and detect faces with the Clarifai Predict API.

The Predict API returns probability scores on the likelihood that the media contains human faces. If human faces are detected, the model will also return the coordinate locations of those faces with a bounding box.

 I am building out the front-end including user authentication (registration, signin, signout) and password creation in a component framework, which is one of the main benefits of using React. 
 
I will also build out the back-end and connect it to a PostgreSQL database.
